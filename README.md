__Bamazon__
*by Johnny Kreitzman*

Bamazon is an application utilizing javascript, node, and SQL that presents the user with a storefront in the terminal.  The quantities update in real time as users buy from the storefront, and if there is insufficient quantity, the user is notified and the transaction does not go through.
